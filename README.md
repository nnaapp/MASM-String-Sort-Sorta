# MASM-String-Sort-Sorta
A string "sort" in assembly, not my idea to do it this way.
Thank my Assembly professor for this cursed sort, the alternative was hard-coded comparisons, and I thought this would be cooler.
Output had to be a hex integer formatted like 0x3421, where 1, 2, 3, and 4 (and other digits) represent a string each.

I strongly suggest just running this through Visual Studio, as assembling MASM is tedious at best. Another of my repositories,
an assignment for determining the endianness of your system, has instructions for assembling you can probably use if you REALLY want to.
But just use Visual Studio.

# Ex:
s1 = "BBB"

s2 = "CCC"

s3 = "AAA"


Output - 0x312
