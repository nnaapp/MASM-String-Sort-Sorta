# MASM-String-Sort-Sorta
A string "sort" in assembly, not my idea to do it this way.
Thank my Assembly professor for this cursed sort, the alternative was hard-coded comparisons, and I thought this would be cooler.
Output had to be a hex integer formatted like 0x3421, where 1, 2, 3, and 4 (and other digits) represent a string each.

# Ex:
s1 = "BBB"
s2 = "CCC"
s3 = "AAA"

Output - 0x312
